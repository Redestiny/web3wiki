            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Memecoins are cryptocurrencies that are typically community-driven and often based on internet memes or humor. While they may not have the same traditional value propositions as other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, their value is largely driven by social media influence, community engagement, and viral trends.</p>
            <p>Despite their volatile price movements and lack of inherent value, memecoins have garnered significant attention due to their fun and irreverent nature, often offering both a speculative investment and a sense of community.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The history of memecoins began in 2013 with the creation of Dogecoin, a coin inspired by the popular "Doge" meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog. Initially created as a parody of Bitcoin, Dogecoin gained traction thanks to its humorous branding and strong community support.</p>
            <p>Over time, other memecoins such as Shiba Inu, Floki Inu, and SafeMoon emerged, each capitalizing on meme culture and social media attention to gain popularity. These coins are often seen as speculative investments, driven more by community hype than fundamental use cases.</p>

        <section id="community" class="section">
            <h2>Community & Culture</h2>
            <p>At the heart of every successful memecoin is its community. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, memecoins thrive on community involvement, social media hype, and meme culture. The communities behind coins like Dogecoin are highly active, often organizing events, charitable donations, and social media campaigns.</p>
            <p>In fact, the value of a memecoin is often more influenced by online discussions, celebrity endorsements, and viral content than by technical advancements or business use cases. This has led to a unique culture surrounding these coins, where humor, memes, and internet culture play a major role in their appeal.</p>
